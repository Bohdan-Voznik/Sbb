            “I am taking time to write this to enlighten folks who are or have never experienced a
            bed bug infestation.
            <strong>There is no way that I can make this a real short story</strong> but I think
            you might be interested in something that you think could never happen to you.
          </p>
          <h2 class="second-title">I never in my wildest dreams did I ever expect to have it happen to me.</h2>
          <p class="text">
            I always lived in a very clean home in suburbia always in an upscale neighborhood.
          </p>

            I had put some things in storage and after a year I decided it was ridiculous to
            keep spending $100.00 a month on stuff that I would probably never use again. So,
            I brought the stuff into my home with the idea of giving most of the things to
            charity. I left the stuff sit for about a week and began getting rid of most of
            these belongings.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            <strong>Well, a few weeks later I noticed two very unfamiliar bugs on my ankle at about
              <span tabindex="0" data-term="goog_2044064696">8 am</span>.</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            After confirming that these were bed bugs, I just flipped out. The first mistake I
            made was to call an extermination company who touted “bed bug control” not
            extermination, but at the time I didn’t care. I wanted these things out of my
            home. I unfortunately signed some papers and after all was said and done I was out
            $4000.00 and I still had bed bugs.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Naturally I called and cursed them out and it seemed whatever I said fell on deaf
            ears. Next, I went to Home Depot and bought every product that even intoned that
            their product killed bed bugs. I sprayed my entire home. By now I’m getting
            educated that there is more to this process than just using pesticides or “bombs”.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            It is extremely important that you vaccum your entire home on a daily basis and do
            lots of laundry on the hottest cycles available to you.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            <strong>I did not begin to see any real positive results until after
              <a class="article-text-link" href="https://www.saybyebugs.com" target="_blank">I
                went online and discovered SayByeBugs.</a></strong>
            I made my first order of two 24 oz. bottles of non toxic bed bug spray, which
            appealed to me in itself. I began spraying behind every picture and yes I saw a
            few behind a few pictures.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Underneath antiques and actually all my furniture. Just think that just a few of
            them can turn into hundreds in a very short time so I cannot emphasize enough that
            you have to be diligent. I live in South Florida where we have all types of creepy
            things but I grew up with them and none ever bothered me like these resilient bed
            bugs.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            There are luxury hotels, cruise ships, and yes storage units and on and on where
            infestations have occurred. It’s usually a hush hush matter with respect to a
            business as you can well imagine why. Nobody is immune from the possibility of
            this happening to them.
          </p>
          <h2>
            <a class="second-title link" href="https://www.saybyebugs.com" target="_blank">Personally, it was
              overwhelming for me until I found SayByeBugs</a>.
          </h2>
          <p class="text">
            Gradually with the spray and laundry products they have developed I began to see
            positive results. It actually took me about a month to finally get a decent nights
            sleep. These bugs are nocturnal so their sleeping lives are the antithesis of
            ours.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            No human can sustain sleep deprivation for a prolonged period of time but that’s
            what happens because they are constantly on your mind after
            <span tabindex="0" data-term="goog_2044064697">midnight</span> until the sun
            rises.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            The ones I had must have been from hell because there wasn’t a hour of the day I
            couldn’t find one at the onset. Truth be told the CIA uses sleep deprivation as a
            form of torture. And when it becomes self inflicted you must act.
          </p>
          <p class="text">

            I just don’t know what I would have done other than trying to sell my home and
            move into a brand new one, which just wasn’t a realistic remedy.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            So, if you have or even travel be exposed get Say Bye Bugs and spray everything.
            I’m talking about baggage and other types of luggage you have used after a trip.
            Spray your luggage outside before bringing it into your home. I know you probably
            think that I am a bed bug paranoia freak.

          <p class="text">
            Well, truth be told after what I experienced I am and you would be as well. Do
            yourself a favor, even if you think it cannot happen to you have a couple spray
            bottles at the ready.

            I cannot thank SayByeBugs enough that they had an inexpensive way do deal with
            this problem. I am not being compensated for this to long of a letter but I just
            would hate to see anyone have to go through what I did. At any rate, I hope I was

                and exterminates them on contact.

              <p class="comment-text"> If you’d uncover your bed lining you could find their nesting grounds filled
                with excrement or even find a few live ones (adult females lay hundreds of
                eggs in their short lifetimes). You will know you’ve been bitten by a bed
                bug if you have several red itchy spots that are often spaced in lines. Most
                common place for bed bugs to bite are arms and shoulders. You might also
                find blood stains on your bed and your sheets. Finding dark spots or skin
                from their shedding is a sure sign too. Good luck!</p>
